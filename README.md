ðŸŒž Hi, Iâ€™m Jess!
I'm new to GitHub and the programming world and I'm interested in exploring it.
I'm looking to start posting projects, complete the META cert, obtain my bachelors in software development and dive into JavaScript more.
If you want to be friends, you can message or tag me through here. ðŸª·
Bye!
